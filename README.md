Vishleshnam: Crowd Detection Analysis System
Vishleshnam is a video analytics solution for crowd behaviour analysis using multiple sensors. This project was part of the DRDO (Government of Ministry, India) project assigned to IIT Bhubaneswar.

Overview
Vishleshnam aims to develop a deep learning model that precisely counts males and females in crowded gatherings and performs activity analysis. Additionally, this system detects the age of people in the crowd.

Project Features
Human Detection: Utilizes a deep learning model to detect head count, age, and gender in the crowd.
Activity Analysis: Analyzes the activity within the crowd for better understanding of crowd dynamics.
Age Detection: Determines the age range of individuals within the crowd.
